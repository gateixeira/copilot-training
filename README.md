# copilot-training

Material for consultation during Copilot demos/trainings.

The code content in this repository is 100% generated by Copilot.

Any demo should start from scratch, trying to reproduce what is present here. However, as any LLM, Copilot will not reproduce an equal copy and may lead to problems. This repository should be used to escape one of these "demo effect" situations :)

The assumption is that the demos consist of two parts:

1. Writing two shell scripts to interact with the GitHub API (create a repository and list repositories in an organization). This shows that Copilot can handle scripting and how an integration with an API works.
2. Implementing a command-line tool that performs basic math operations. This, though simple, shows how fast one can go from 0 to a functional tool that includes tests and validations. The benefit of a CLI tool is that pretty much any of the most popular languages can support it with minimal effort and library utilization.
